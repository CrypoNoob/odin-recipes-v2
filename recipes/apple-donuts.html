  <h1>Apple donuts</h1>

  Ingredients for two servings (8 pieces):
  2 medium apples
  3 tablespoons maple syrup
  A quarter teaspoon of cinnamon
  egg
  5 tablespoons white cheese
  A tablespoon of peanut butter
  Half a teaspoon of baking powder
  
  How to prepare for the apple base:
  Slice a medium sweet apple not peeled into 4 slices about 1 cm thick, and remove the seeds so that a hole remains in the center.

  Put the maple and cinnamon in a pan and fry over low heat until slightly thickened.

  Add the apple slices and fry until caramelized.

  Put them on a cooling plate at room temperature.


  How to prepare for the donut batter:
 
  Mix the egg, white cheese, peanut butter and baking powder.

  Dip the apples in the batter with a fork and shake off excess.

  Fry in a pan (with oil spray) until golden on both sides.
 
  Using a spoon, open the hole if it is clogged and dust with a little powdered sugar.
